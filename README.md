# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado board of elections employee has asked for election results to perform an election audit. The audit includes the total number of votes cast, a list of the candidates, the total number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. In addition to this, the election commission has requested additional information to complete the audit. The new request includes, the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout.
